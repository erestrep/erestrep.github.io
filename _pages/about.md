I am a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) Tenured Researcher (Chargé de Recherche) in the [Rainbow team](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/) at [IRISA - CNRS](https://www.irisa.fr/en), Rennes, France.

Previously, from February 2023 to October 2024 I have been a post-doctoral researcher in the [Rainbow Team](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/) at IRISA - CNRS, Rennes, France, working with Dr. [Paolo Robuffo Giordano](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/). From January 2022 to January 2023, I was a Postdoctoral researcher in the [Division of Decision and Control Systems](https://www.kth.se/is/dcs/division-of-decision-and-control-systems-1.788078) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, working with [Dr. Dimos V. Dimarogonas](https://people.kth.se/~dimos/). 

In November 2021 I successfully defended my thesis titled ["Coordination control of autonomous robotic multi-agent systems under constraints,"](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03537341) obtaining the Ph.D. degree in Automatic Control from the Université Paris-Saclay.
I carried out my Ph.D. from October 2018 to November 2021 at [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/en) and the [Laboratory of Signals and Systems (L2S, UMR 8506)](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/en/) under the supervision of [Dr. Antonio Loría](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/en/u/loria-antonio/), Dr. Julien Marzat, and Dr. Ioannis Sarras.

I obtained the MSc degree from [Arts et Métiers](https://artsetmetiers.fr/en), Paris, France, in 2018, and the BSc degree from [Universidad EIA](https://www.eia.edu.co/#), Envigado, Colombia and from Arts et Métiers, Paris, France, in 2017.

My research is centered on **control of multi-robot systems** using tools from dynamical systems, control theory, and graph theory. In particular, my principal research activity is centered in the control design, study, and analysis of groups of autonomous robotic vehicles (ground, aerial, and marine) both from the control-theoretic and the practical-implementation perspectives.
