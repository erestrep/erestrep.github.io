**Short abstract:** The objective of this Master’s thesis is to develop a **distributed strategy** for the coordination of a multi-robot system subject to **multiple constraints** (e.g. collision avoidance, connectivity and visibility maintenance) and performing **multiple objectives** (etc. coverage missions, clustering), while being **resilient** to robot failure or mission and environmental changes.

**Description and motivation:** The deployment of **robotic fleets** has proven effective for various cooperative tasks such as reconnaissance, surveillance, load transportation, and imaging. While a fixed number of agents can perform short-term tasks like formation tracking or area coverage, this approach becomes limiting in practical, **long-term missions**. Such missions often exceed the robots’ battery life, requiring agents to temporarily leave for recharging and rejoin later. Additionally, in dynamic or adversarial environments, robot failures or attacks are inevitable, and new robots may need to join as tasks or environments evolve. Hence, agent addition and removal are inherent to realistic multi-robot operations. These additions and removals, however, demand **resilient strategies** capable of managing agent changes while ensuring the satisfaction of **inter-agent constraints** and overall mission objectives.

To address these challenges, this master thesis builds upon a **generalized biconnectivity framework** [1,2] where the interconnection between robots is defined as a product of weights that encode factors like **proximity-based interactions** (distance-dependent), **sensing limitations** (field-of-view constraints), **hard constraints** (collision avoidance, connectivity maintenance) and **soft constraints** (formation control, cooperative behavior), and that is resilient to the removal or addition of agents due to, e.g., failure, battery discharge, changing mission specifications or environmental conditions. Then, relying on the **distributed Control Barrier Function (CBF) framework** [3]​, this thesis will study how to provide an optimal controller for the coordination of a multi-robot system that satisfies the system’s constraints and that is resilient to a change in the number of robots.


**General Objectives:** The goal of this Master Thesis is to propose a distributed strategy based on the results of [1,2,3] in order to achieve **resilient coordination in a team of multiple robots subject to multiple constraints and objectives**. The proposed algorithms will be **validated through simulations and experiments** using a team of mobile robots (ground robots and mini-drones).

By integrating a **resilient generalized biconnectivity strategy with the CBF framework**, this thesis will contribute to the development of **next-generation resilient multi-robot systems** capable of operating in real-world, dynamic environments.
