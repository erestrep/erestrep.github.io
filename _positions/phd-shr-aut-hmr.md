    Demonstration of a 6-DoF haptic interface used for controlling multiple drones in a coordinated operation. The interface provides real-time feedback, allowing the operator to intuitively maneuver the swarm of drones for tasks like surveillance and exploration, with visual and haptic cues enhancing situational awareness and precision.

<h3 class="subsection-title">Context</h3>
<br>

**Human-robot collaboration** has recently shown promising advances, sparking research on intuitive robot control for collaborative tasks. In particular, by integrating robotic technologies into food and industrial contexts, human-robot collaboration can address challenges of sustainability and efficiency, placing humans at the center of innovative production systems. However, human-multi-robot interaction remains underexplored, especially in scenarios where **heterogeneous robot teams** collaborate on complex missions with multiple objectives. Indeed, the limitations of each robot can be compensated by combining different robots within the same team, thus collaborating seamlessly to achieve a common goal. For example, transporting a heavy object may be difficult or even impossible for a single robot. In contrast, a multi-robot system can overcome this limitation. This requires intuitive interfaces that allow users to control and coordinate, remotely or within the same workspace, robot teams capable of interacting with each other and their environment.

<br>
<h3 class="subsection-title">Envisaged activities</h3>
<br>

Three major open questions remain regarding human-multi-robot collaboration: (1) Interfaces and flexibility: How can we design interfaces that enable operators to intuitively control heterogeneous robot teams while facilitating dynamic team splitting and merging operations? (2) Safe interactions: How can we ensure safe interactions, adapting robot autonomy to operator capabilities while prioritizing the safety of both humans and robots? (3) Situational awareness: How can we enhance operators’ ability to track team and mission status through relevant and optimized feedback?

This PhD aims to advance the state of the art in three directions: (1) **Shared control:** Developing techniques that allow humans to give high-level intuitive commands (e.g., linear velocity of a load), which are then transformed into realistic motion plans by the group’s autonomy. Visual and haptic feedback will enrich the understanding of robot actions. (2) **Autonomous coordination:** Using passivity-based techniques to ensure smooth transitions between human and autonomous control while guaranteeing stable interactions despite uncertainties. (3) **Haptic feedback:** Developing methods to provide intuitive haptic feedback, helping operators better understand team actions and perform collaborative tasks safely.

**Experimental validation:** the control methods and algorithms will be validated and tested on human-multi-robot collaborative tasks using the facilities of the Rainbow team, including two indoor and multi-robot arenas, several mobile robots, and haptic interfaces (see picture).
