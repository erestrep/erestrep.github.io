**Description:** How can a team of robots work together to push and transport unknown objects without prior knowledge of their properties? This Master’s thesis aims to develop innovative distributed control algorithms that enable a group of mobile robots to autonomously manipulate objects of unknown properties (mass, friction, and center of mass), overcoming sensing and actuation constraints through intelligent collaboration.

**Motivations:** Pushing is one of the simplest yet most powerful ways for robots to interact with their environment, with applications spanning from warehouse logistics to autonomous construction and precision agriculture. While traditional approaches rely on a single robot—often a robotic arm in controlled settings—real-world scenarios demand more flexibility.

Multi-robot teams offer a promising alternative, allowing for scalable and robust non-prehensile manipulation strategies. However, current methods often assume prior knowledge of object properties or impose restrictive configurations, limiting their applicability to dynamic and unpredictable environments. This project seeks to bridge that gap by designing adaptive and distributed control strategies for teams of mobile robots engaged in collaborative pushing.

**General Objectives:** The goal of this Master Thesis is to develop novel distributed control algorithms that allow a team of mobile robots to push and manipulate objects without prior knowledge of their properties. Moreover, the team of robots should be able to adapt and reconfigure dynamically when dealing with different objects, taking into account constraints such as limited sensing range, field of view, and actuation capabilities. The proposed algorithms will be validated through simulations and real-world experiments using a team of mobile robots.

This thesis will provide exciting opportunities to explore cutting-edge control methodologies for multi-robot collaboration.
